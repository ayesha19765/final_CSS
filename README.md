# Cyber Sanrakshak  

## Project Description:  

Cyber Sanrakshak is an advanced Context-Aware Firewall designed to enhance network security by leveraging machine learning and feature engineering. It provides administrators with a robust system to define, monitor, and enforce security rules based on domain, application, host, or IP-based attributes. The solution focuses on anomaly detection, enabling proactive threat prevention and a detailed log-based analysis for network behavior monitoring.  

## Overview:  
Cyber Sanrakshak was developed as part of the Smart India Hackathon 2024 to address challenges in network security management. The project provides a cross-platform firewall solution that integrates an admin dashboard, backend services, and a firewall agent for comprehensive monitoring and control.

## Features:  

### **Firewall Rules:**  
- Domain-based filtering for enhanced content control.  
- Application-level monitoring and restriction.  
- Host and IP address-based rule enforcement.  

### **Anomaly Detection:**  
- Machine learning model to detect and prevent malicious behavior in real-time.  
- Proactive analysis based on client logs and system activity.  

### **Admin Dashboard:**  
- User-friendly interface for managing firewall rules and reviewing logs.  
- Dynamic visualization of network activity and security events.  

### **Monitoring Prototype:**  
- A desktop-based firewall monitoring tool to observe and control system activities.

## Design Requirements:  

### **Architecture:**  
- **Top-Level Architecture:**  
  - Backend service for handling rule definitions and real-time monitoring.  
  - Socket connections for real-time updates between firewall agent and server.  

### **Tech Stack:**  
- Frontend: Next.js  
- Backend: Node.js  
- Database: MongoDB  
- Machine Learning: Python-based anomaly detection  

### **Responsiveness:**  
- The admin dashboard and monitoring tools are designed to work seamlessly across multiple devices.

## Local Setup:  

1. Clone both repositories:  
   - [Frontend Repository](https://github.com/ayesha19765/firewall-frontend/tree/1b2d9935a425f36e2322c00144f8249874e7fc98)  
   - [Backend Repository](https://github.com/Ayush-Vish/SIH-Context-Aware-Firewall/tree/7f6354c645c5bf2db38f1243208e6a68f0d0ee0f)  

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   cd firewall-frontend
   npm install
   cd ../firewall-backend
   npm install
   ```  

3. Start services:  
   - Run the backend:  
     ```bash
     node server.js
     ```  
   - Start the frontend:  
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```  

4. Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`.
